## [Get Started!](https://github.com/KathrynMorgan/mini-stack/tree/master/Index)

## Purpose:

>This tooling provides a common platform to quickly and seamlessly build virtual environments.
>
>The original inspiration for this project came from endless hours of testing different virtual 
>network building tools and strategies in search of a paradigm that meets a number of criteria.

#### Easy integration of technologies including:
  + Docker

  + Libvirt / QEMU+KVM
  + Bare Metal Hosts
  + Physical Switching Gear

#### Easy end-user management and setup:
  + Logical to comprehend
  + Easy to setup
  + Easy to manage
  + Easy to use over Wifi connections
  + Easy to integrate physical network gear
  + Capable of multi-host overlays
  + Capable of nesting multiple layers of networks

#### The tooling also needs to be consistent across hardware platforms including:
  + client laptops
