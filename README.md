# Hypervisor Lab & Development Stack [mini-stack]
## [Get Started Here!](https://github.com/KathrynMorgan/mini-stack/tree/master/Index)

Intended for both the new hobby sysadmin and experienced DevOps professional. <br/>
This set of guides & build tools is aimed at the Single Host Laptop/Desktop "Lab Server" Paradigm and can be expanded upon once the core fundamentals are understood. <br/>
By following these guides you will be able to: <br/>
  1. Demostrate the potential of modest hardware <br/>
  2. Improve your understandng and fluency in fitting common commercial software components together <br/> 
  3. Overcome barriers in consuming automation tools to improve your workflow beyond the burden of menial tasks <br/>


## Purpose:

This tooling provides a common platform to quickly and seamlessly build virtual environments. <br/>
<br/>
The original inspiration for this project came from endless hours of testing different 
virtual network building tools and strategies in search of a paradigm that meets a 
number of criteria included in the following.

#### The tooling also needs to be consistent across hardware platforms including:
  + Client Laptops
  + Client Desktops
  + Low cost Home Labs
  + DevOps Lab Servers
  + 100% Virtual Tenants
  + Multi-Host Rack Systems

#### Easy end-user management and setup:
  + Logical to comprehend
  + Easy to setup
  + Easy to manage
  + Capable of multi-host overlays
  + Easy to use over Wifi connections
  + Capable of nesting multiple layers of networks

#### Easy integration of technologies including:
  + Docker
  + LXD / LXC
  + Libvirt / QEMU / KVM
  + OpenStack
  + Kubernetes
  + Bare Metal Hosts
  + Physical Switching Gear

#### Example of a single host build following these steps:
